## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course *CMS.611J Creating Video Games* as it was taught by Philip Tan, Sara Verrilli, Richard Eberhardt, and Andrew Haydn Grant in Fall 2014.

In this course, students learned creative design and production methods while working together in small teams to design, develop, and thoroughly test their own original digital games. Design iteration across all aspects of video game development was stressed. Students were required to support and challenge their game design decisions with focus testing and data analysis.

## Course Outcomes

### Course Goals for Students

- Learn how to work in a team to solve a creative problem
- Implement productive project management strategies
- Apply the iterative process to all aspects of video game development, including game design, audio design, visual aesthetics, fiction writing, programming, and project management)
- Engage in playtesing and data analysis
- Gain exposure to professionals in the industry
- Gain experience working with a client

### Possibilities for Further Study/Careers

Students interested in designing games for entertainment often go on to take *CMS.617 Advanced Game Studio* and *CMS.610 Media Industries and Systems*. Students interested in designing games for education usually take [*CMS.615 Games for Social Change*](/courses/cms-615-games-for-social-change-fall-2013) and [*CMS.590J Computer Games and Simulations for Investigation and Education*](/courses/11-127j-computer-games-and-simulations-for-education-and-exploration-spring-2015). Some students develop an academic interest in games, and for them, courses like [*CMS.300 Introduction to Videogame Studies*](/courses/cms-300-introduction-to-videogame-studies-fall-2011) and *CMS.616J Games and Culture* provide a good foundation for their work.

## A Closer Look

*The following video provides a closer look at the development of one team’s final project game, Hello Waves. Capturing each step in the team’s iterative process, the video gives educators an in-depth view into how the team took their idea from pitch to product.*

### Instructor Insights on Assessment

This course focused on teaching students effective processes and procedures for working as a team on a complex, multi-functional project. While it was important for them to deliver projects successfully, we were more interested in helping students learn how to practice and improve their project management and group teamwork skills. Their project grades depended heavily on the methods, tools, and processes they used to develop their games, as well as the justification and explanation of the choices they made in organizing their teams and projects. We used multiple methods to capture this information, including presentations, written reports, design diaries, project management documentation, and mandatory in-class play testing sessions.

## Student Information

### Enrollment

41 students

### Breakdown by Year

Mostly sophomores, juniors, and seniors.

### Breakdown by Major

- Mostly {{% resource_link "1815162e-8bd2-41b5-ad3b-3c43f4dc4145" "Electrical Engineering and Computer Science" %}} undergraduate students and {{% resource_link "6cd7f05b-be6a-451b-9281-0eb8dc45b3e1" "Comparative Media Studies/Writing" %}} undergraduate students.
- Typically, undergraduates from fields such as biology, mathematics, mechanical engineering, physics and oceanography also enroll.

### Typical Student Background

During the Fall 2014 offering of the course, women constituted 1/4 of the class.

Students brought very different tastes and experiences to the class based on having played games throughout their lives, but students did not have to be “gamers” to enroll or excel in the course.

### Ideal Class Size

The ideal class size is 30-35 students per section. This size allows students have the opportunity to work on multiple teams with different students on each, as well as to form teams for the final project that are big enough to fail. We purposefully set teams up for the final project to have communication issues (having 7-8 students on a single team) because part of their challenge is to use the tools and methods we provide to overcome the challenge. A class size of about 35 students is still small enough, however, to allow instructors to get to know students well. This is important because it helps instructors assess and intervene when teams are having motivational or interpersonal issues.

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### In Class

Met 2 times per week for 3 hours per session; 27 sessions total; mandatory attendance.

Use of class time varied widely as students moved through different stages of each project. Main activities, with approximate average time spent, included:

- {{% resource_link "dc33d4c4-d205-4bc6-351b-fd20bc6fc55a" "Lectures" %}} (1-2 hours/week)
- Discussion (1 hour/week)
- Workshop (1 hour/week)
- Playtesting (variable)
- Presentations (variable)

### Out of Class

Students completed most of their game project development outside of class, working collaboratively to meet regular deadlines.
