The Game
--------

{{< resource uuid="158cb54d-4554-f210-bd4f-0e9076758900" href="/ans7870/CMS/CMS.611/f14/games/hello-waves/game/index.html" >}}

_Hello Waves_ is a game that deals with a topic known as forecast-based financing, which aims to create new funding mechanisms for disaster preparedness.

Disaster risk reduction efforts traditionally focus on long-term preventative measures or post-disaster response. There are also many short-term actions, such as evacuation, that can be implemented to reduce the risk of impacts in the period of time between a warning and a potential disaster. However, this precious window of opportunity is regularly overlooked in the case of climate and weather forecasts, which can indicate heightened risk of disaster but are rarely used to initiate preventative action.

Forecast-based financing matches threshold forecast probabilities with appropriate actions, disburses required funding when threshold forecasts are issued, and develops standard operating procedures for when these threshold forecasts are issued.

In this game, you will play the role of someone trying to prevent ocean waves from destroying sandcastles, by using the tools of forecast-based financing.
